         <em>Markdown is a way you style your text. Here is a simple guide on how to use it.</em>
      </p>
      <h3>Titles</h3>
      <p>if you want to have a title you need a # at the start of the line.</p>
      <p>for example:</p>
      <blockquote>
         <code>
            <p>#This is my title</p>
            <p>This is a line under that title</p>
         </code>
      </blockquote>

      <p>will look like this when you load the website:</p>

      <blockquote>
         <h1>This is my title</h1>
         <p>This is a line under that title</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>use 2 of them to get a smaller title</p>
      <blockquote>
         <code>
            </p>##This is my title</p>
            <p>This is a line under that title<p>
         </code>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
         <h2>This is my title</h2>
         This is a line under that title
      </blockquote>
